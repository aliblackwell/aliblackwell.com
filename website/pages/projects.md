      <p class="highlight text-large">Over the years I've been lucky enough for my work to align with my values.</p>
      <p>Alongside my <a href="./?tag=entrepreneurship">entrepreneurship</a> I am primarily a <a href="./?tag=full-stack" class="inline">designer and full-stack developer</a>. Many people know me from the world of <a href="./?tag=tech-education">technology education</a>, but my professional interests lie in <a href="./?tag=crypto">crypto/socioeconomics</a>, <a href="./?tag=info-sec">infosec/AI</a>, and <a href="./?tag=political-tech">campaign/election technology</a>.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy a number of <a href="./?tag=other">projects away from the screen</a>.</p>
