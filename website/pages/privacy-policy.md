At JamstackStarter we reject all products and services that allow tracking scripts or tracking cookies to be installed on our users' devices.

We don't use cookies.

The only third-party service we use is Stripe, to handle our payments, and we embed their JavaScript using the "?advancedFraudSignals=false" flag that disables the tracking they use for fraud purposes - but could use for more nefarious purposes if their management team wanted to. So we disable it.

JamstackStarter has been built with love and care to protect its users' privacy.
