      <p class="text-large highlight">In 2018 I was asked to be the celebrant at a dear friend's wedding. It was a magical day filled with love, and it helped me appreciate the importance of ritual and ceremony.</p>
      <p>Since then I've learnt practical skills that have confirmed what I've long suspected; that invisible energy, the kind  behind Einstein's "spooky action at a distance", connects us all.</p> 
      <p>I am a keen dowser, both for earth energies and to facilitate the return of harmony to fields worn out by living.</p>
      <p>I have studied under world-leading Sound Healer practitioners Tim Wheater and Cherub, learning the transcendental power of harmonic resonance via tingshaw, shruti box, voice and gong.</p>

      <p>I am excited to introduce my unique offering to the world â€” in the fullness of time. Stay tuned!</p>
