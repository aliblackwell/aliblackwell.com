        text: "Universal design is our way of living up to Tim Berners Lee's founding
          words for the web: 'This is for everyone'. Inclusive design principles
          ensure accessibility is never a bolt on. It's for us all."

      - title: Private by default
        text: We would never install trackers like Google Analytics or do anything to
          compromise your privacy. This site doesn't need a cookie notice
          because we don't use the technologies GDPR exists to protect you from.

      - title: Completely customisable
        text: Just like your plumber, you'll enjoy working with us but you don't want to
          be calling us... ever again. Our simple CMS allows you to update your
          site and even create new pages and layouts. You're empowered. We're
          delighted.

        blurb: My career has seen me launch a global business, lead a bunch of cutting-edge product teams, work at the bleeding edge of blockchain/cryptoeconomics, and most recently launch an AI-powered product that detects if your cat is typing on your keyboard. Everything I've done has been accessible, ethically motivated and private by default.
