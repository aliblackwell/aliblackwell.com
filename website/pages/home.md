        blurb: My career has seen me launch a global business, lead a bunch of cutting-edge product teams, work at the bleeding edge of blockchain/cryptoeconomics, and most recently launch an AI-powered product that detects if your cat is typing on your keyboard. Everything I've done has been accessible, ethically motivated and private by default.
