    testimonial: Ali and Imogen's "1-day website wonder" workshop totally transformed my experience of creating a website. No more going back and forth for weeks, no more feeling stuck and frustrated - I sat next to Ali at various times during the day and was totally involved in the design process. I felt I was an integral part of the crafting process and could see my feedback implemented in real time. Ali works really quickly and is totally solution focused in his approach. Imogen's colour sessions allowed me to release any block I had around launching my website, being visible and finding the "right" words for my copy. Creating and launching a website can be an emotional experience (there is so much at stake when you put yourself "out there") but this magical duo made it exciting, light and fun. Not only I'm delighted with and proud of the final result but the energy emanating from my website reflects the creativity and love that went into it. I really feel my website is an authentic reflection of what I offer. This is a revolution in website design services! Thank you!!
